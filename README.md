## 📌 Project Overview  
Hospitals generate a vast amount of data daily, including patient records, treatments, admissions, procedures, and financial transactions. Managing this information manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this, **MediSight – Interactive Hospital Dashboard** was developed as a decision-support tool that transforms raw hospital data into actionable insights.

## 📊 Dataset Source and Description  
The dataset used in this project was derived from publicly available hospital management datasets on Kaggle. It includes patient-level information such as admissions, treatments, procedures, conditions, satisfaction ratings, length of stay, readmission status, gender, and financial records.  

**Key Fields:**  
- **Patient Information:** Gender, readmission status, reason for visit, condition.  
- **Hospital Utilization:** Length of Stay, Procedure details, Doctor IDs.  
- **Financial Metrics:** Revenue associated with each patient’s treatment.  
- **Feedback:** Patient satisfaction scores (1–5 scale).

## 💡 Business Problem  
Hospitals generate large volumes of operational and financial data daily, making manual tracking inefficient and error-prone. The key business challenges include:  
- Identifying which procedures and conditions drive higher patient inflows.  
- Understanding revenue distribution across different lengths of stay.  
- Evaluating doctor involvement across procedures.  
- Monitoring patient satisfaction to improve quality of care.  

The dashboard provides an **interactive decision-support tool** for hospital administrators to:  
✅ Monitor operations  
✅ Optimize resource allocation  
✅ Improve patient outcomes

## 🔎 Key Insights from the Dashboard  

### 💰 Financial Insights  
- The total hospital revenue recorded is **₹1.91M**.  
- Short stays contribute comparatively little to overall revenue.  

### 🏥 Operational Insights  
- The most frequently performed procedure is **Surgery and Chemotherapy (21 cases)**, followed by **Angioplasty** and **CT Scan/Medication**.  
- Procedures like **Physical Therapy** and **Postnatal Care** show strong demand, indicating a mix of emergency and routine services.  
- Doctor involvement is diverse, but some procedures require significantly more doctors, highlighting resource-intensive areas.  

### 👩‍⚕️ Patient Insights  
- The average satisfaction score is **3.55 (out of 5)** → moderate satisfaction.  
- Most patients rated **4 or 5**, but many gave **2 or 3**, suggesting room for improvement.  
- Highest number of visits are linked to **Cancer, Heart Disease, Stroke, and Diabetes** → critical hospital focus areas.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
The **MediSight Dashboard** provides hospital administrators with a clear view of:  
- **Revenue Drivers:** Longer hospital stays generate higher revenue.  
- **Resource Planning:** High-demand procedures (e.g., chemotherapy, angioplasty) need better doctor allocation.  
- **Quality Improvement:** Patient satisfaction suggests opportunities to enhance service quality.  

By leveraging these insights, hospitals can improve efficiency, optimize resources, and deliver **better patient care outcomes**.
